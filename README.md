# Clustering by Business Income and Expenses

This repository focuses on clustering analysis using the K-means algorithm to analyze business income and expense data. The goal is to segment businesses based on their income and expenses, helping to identify patterns or groups for targeted decision-making.

## Steps Covered

1. **Load and Visualize Data**  
   Load the dataset containing business income and expense data. Visualize the data using scatter plots to identify any patterns or relationships between the features.

2. **Prepare Data for Cluster Analysis**  
   Prepare the dataset for clustering, ensuring the data is clean and scaled, making it suitable for the K-means clustering algorithm.

3. **Perform Centroid Clustering with K-Means**  
   Apply the K-means algorithm to perform centroid-based clustering on the income and expense data. The K-means algorithm helps in grouping similar businesses based on their financial characteristics.

4. **Interpret Clustering Results**  
   Analyze the resulting clusters and determine their characteristics. For example, understanding how different income and expense ranges create different groups of businesses.

5. **Determine the Optimal Number of Clusters**  
   Use techniques like the Elbow method or Silhouette score to determine the optimal number of clusters for the dataset, improving the clustering analysis.

## Key Concepts

- **K-Means Clustering**: A popular clustering algorithm that divides data into K clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster.
  
- **Elbow Method**: A technique used to determine the number of clusters by plotting the explained variance as a function of the number of clusters and finding the "elbow" point.

- **Silhouette Score**: A method to evaluate the quality of clusters. It measures how similar a point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters.
